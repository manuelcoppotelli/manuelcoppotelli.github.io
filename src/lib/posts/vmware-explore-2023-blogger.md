VMware Explore 2023 has just ended and I'm back at home with a lot of news
regarding the company merging with Broadcom, the new announcements, and new
product features. This year I had the honor and the pleasure to be
<MarkerHighlight>involved as Independent Blogger</MarkerHighlight> for the event.

During the event I kept on my Youtube vlogging activity,
[live streaming](https://www.youtube.com/@thepipelineguys/streams)
from the venue and interviewing partecipants.

I had a lot of conversations with VMware staff and vendor eco-systems and now
it's time to share news and perspectives.

## VMware and Broadcom: the wait is ended!

Probably the most "rumored" topic of the year is the state of company merging
which is taking the necessary time to overcome financials and organizational
issues (definitely not my space).

Technically speaking there are three main pillars where Hock E. Tan (President,
CEO, and director of Broadcom) is reassuring VMware will continue to work:

- Innovation: Accelerate R&D
- Eco-system: More investments helping partners to improve customer support
- Operation: simplifying VMware's adoption and experience

So these good vibes felt during the keynote and during the Europe VMUG leaders
gathering (got the chance to meet Hock Tan there), should keep away the specter
of the "dismemberment" of the most important virtualization company in the world!

So, the next weeks are crucial and I'm looking forward to hearing something
(positive) coming from the company itself but also from the community inside and
outside the company.

In the meantime, on the 21st of November 2023, Broadcom announced the completion
of the acquisition (link to official announcements).

## Private AI

For sure this is the buzzword of the event but also the buzzword of the year or
better the buzzword of the last period and here I'd like to demystify some of
the misconceptions that are pervading a lot of "social" conversation when the
topic is AI. This is definitely not the end of man-made things, this is another
important human evolution step to solve some other repetitive tasks and
accelerate/simplify the ways we're doing things every day.

I mean, there's no "judgment day" like sci-fi literature is prophecying due to
the use and abuse of Artificial Intelligence; the purpose of AI in my case, is
to help infrastructure operations and for sure none aims to delegate AI to press
the "red button" to initiate the disaster recovery process. In my opinion,
automation is not supposed to not be used to make critical decisions instead of
human operators but could be the chance for humans to make better decisions by
getting more information about what is happening and how the disaster could
evolve. This is the purpose of Private AI: no critical data can go outside the
data center and there's a "tireless personal assistant" to help you manage
workloads.

## Cloud-Native Space

Since the beginning of the Tanzu journey, I've seen a lot of improvements and
announcements. During the keynote session, Raghu Raghuram announced some cool
features in cloud-native space and here I want to highlight two of them that I
found most valuable:

Tanzu Application Engine introduces an application-centric layer to allow
applications to run with consistent operational governance. Checking the
official [announcement](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/introducing-vmware-tanzu-application-engine):

> Developers will be able to focus on their applications without worrying about
> infrastructure details, platform engineers will be able to focus on managing
> and operating infrastructure at scale, and operators will be able to define
> configurations to meet organizational governance and compliance requirements.

This should be a further step toward reducing the gap between the developers'
methodology and cloud-native deployment. VMware announced this topic during
VMware Explore in Las Vegas and now is available as Tech Preview.

Tanzu Developer Portal is an internal developer portal in the Tanzu Application
Platform. This integration is based on [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) and
helps to simplify the development team organization. In a few words: this could
be the definitive single pane of glass to handle the software lifecycle and the
contribution by the organizations. For more details, check
[the Vegas' announcement](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer-portal).
