We have been waited for a long time... and now it is back
_VMware code Hackathon_, the maximum expression of community in one place.

This year I wanted to throw my hat in as team captain, proposing to carry on
the topic of "VMware Tanzu and Tanzu Application Platform".

Since the dismission of Tanzu Community Edition (ðŸ˜¢) the main idea was to
provide an out-of-the box-integration of may tools (e.g. minikube, carvel, ...)
in order to create a lightweight or mock environment for Tanzu that can run easily
on a developer's laptop.

The final result was a demo showing how, starting from source code and Dockerfile
a developer could iterate fast on its local laptop without any infrastructure
but, at the same time, deploy on Tanzu with no further effort.

You can look at [the slides](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli/code-hackaton-2023/blob/main/slides.pdf)
and the [source code](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli/code-hackaton-2023)
on my github.

The other teams had wide bigger (and complex) ideas, even thow I didn't officially
win the context, I really had fun in giving the final speech and keeping the
audience (and the gury) highly enthusiast on the topic.
