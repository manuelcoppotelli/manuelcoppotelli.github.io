For example, an <code>m5.large</code> can\nhave up to 10 IPs for ENI; out of those 10 IPs one of them has to be assigned to\nthe network interface itself while the remaining can be assigned freely.</p>\n<p>In the past, these extra IPs were assign to Pods but there was a big limit: the\nnumber of assignable IP addresses for each node.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at an example.</p>\n<p>An <code>m5.large</code> EC2 instance can have up to 3 ENIs with 10 IP private addresses\neach. Since one IP is reserved for the ENI, remains left 9 addresses per ENI and\nthus 27 in total. As a conseuences the EC2 <code>m5.large</code> could run up to 27 Pods,\nnot a lot actually.</p>\n<h2>Let’s enter prefixes</h2>\n<p>In August 2021 AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/it/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/amazon-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-customers-can-assign-ip-prefixes-ec2-instances/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released a change</a>\nto EC2 that allows <em>prefixes</em> to be assigned to network interfaces.</p>\n<figure><picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-multiple-eni-prefix.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n    <source srcset=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-multiple-eni-prefix.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n    <img src=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-multiple-eni-prefix.png\" alt=\"Kubernetes AWS CNI Multiple ENI using prefixes\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"></picture>\n  \n</figure>\n<p>Prefixes?! In simple words, instead of supporting a single IP address, ENIs now\nsupport an IP range. Thus the same EC2 instance, which had 10 private IP\naddresses, now can have 10 <strong>ranges</strong> of IP addresses. And how big is the range?\nBy default, 16 IP addresses; so with 10 ranges <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">you could have\nup to 160 IP addresses</span>.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at another example.</p>\n<figure><picture class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"><source srcset=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-pods-prefix.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n    <source srcset=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-pods-prefix.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n    <img src=\"/images/posts/aws-eks-high-density-pods/aws-cni-pods-prefix.png\" alt=\"Kubernetes AWS CNI pods prefixes\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"svelte-1gy5t1o\"></picture>\n  \n</figure>\n<p>An <code>m5.large</code> can have 3 ENIs with 10 slots each for IPs or <em>prefixes</em>; since\none IP is reserved for the ENI, you’re left with 9 <em>prefixes</em>.

Since there are 3 ENIs, <code>144x3=432</code> IPs.</p>\n<p>The same EC2 can now runs <span class=\"wrapper svelte-1sgfl7c\">up to 432 Pods</span>, not\nonly 27 as before!</p>\n<h2>AWS CNI 1.9 and Pod-per-node limit</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/it/blogs/containers/amazon-vpc-cni-increases-pods-per-node-limits/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AWS CNI 1.9.0</a> includes support to prefixes and\ncaps the max number of Pods to 110 or 250 so you won’t be able to run 432 Pods\non an m5.large; the latter in comòiance with the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes large clusters</a>\nguide recommendation.

Since one IP is reserved for the ENI, remains left 9 addresses per ENI and\nthus 27 in total.

In simple words, instead of supporting a single IP address, ENIs now\nsupport an IP range.
